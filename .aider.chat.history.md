Technical Specification (TS) – Family Tree Builder Application
1. Project Overview

The Family Tree Builder is a software application designed to create, edit, and visualize family trees. The program allows users to store personal information about relatives, track relationships, attach media files, and generate multi-generation diagrams.
The app is intended for genealogy research, family history documentation, and personal use.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Person Profile Management

The program must allow users to:

Add new family members

Edit or delete existing profiles

Enter personal details:

Full name

Date of birth / death

Occupation (optional)

2.2 Relationship Management

The system must support:

Parent → Child links

Sibling relationships

Marriage / partnership links

Divorce / separation

Multiple marriages

Step-family or adopted family connections

2.3 Tree Visualization

The app should generate a visual family tree:

Horizontal or vertical layout

Expand/collapse generation levels

Display key data next to each person

Smooth navigation (scrolling, zooming)

Highlight selected individual and direct relatives

Optional visualization modes:

Pedigree chart

Descendant chart

Full tree chart

2.4 Search and Filtering

The program must support:

Search by name

Search by date of birth or death

Filters:

By generation

By surname

By branch of the family

Quick navigation to a selected person

2.5 Media and Documents

Users should be able to:

Attach photos (PNG/JPG)

Attach documents (PDF/notes)

Link media to specific events (e.g., wedding, birth)

View gallery for each family member

The system may include a timeline showing:

Birth dates

Marriages

Important historical or personal events

Users can view the timeline per individual or for the entire family.

2.7 Data Backup & Export

The application must support:

Exporting family tree to:

PDF (diagram)

Image (PNG)

GEDCOM (common genealogy format)

Importing data from GEDCOM

Local backup and restore

2.8 User Notes & Tags

Users can:

Add personal notes

Assign tags (e.g., “research needed”, “confirmed”, “maternal line”)

Mark incomplete data

3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Platform

The program can be:

Desktop app (Windows/Mac/Linux)

Web application

Mobile app (optional)

3.2 Performance

Trees with up to 1,000 individuals should load within 1 second

Smooth zoom and navigation

Efficient memory usage for large trees

3.3 Data Storage

Local database (SQLite recommended) or local JSON/XML files

Optionally: cloud sync

3.4 Security

Family data must be stored locally unless cloud sync is explicitly enabled

If cloud sync is used → encryption required

3.5 Usability

Intuitive interface

Drag-and-drop features for rearranging tree (optional)

Undo/redo support

4. Technical Stack (Recommended)
Option A – Desktop Application (Python)

Python

PyQt5 or Tkinter

SQLite for database

Graphviz/d3-like library for visualization

Option B – Web Application

Frontend: React / Vue.js

Backend: Node.js / Django

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

Visualization: D3.js

Option C – Mobile

Flutter or React Native

5. Future Extensions

DNA test integration (Ancestry/23andMe style)

Collaboration between multiple users

Automatic tree generation from uploaded documents

AI-powered relationship suggestion (optional)

Historical map of family migrations
```
