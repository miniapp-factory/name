+Code the following app
+```
+Technical Specification (TS) – Family Tree Builder Application
+1. Project Overview
+
+The Family Tree Builder is a software application designed to create, edit, and visualize family trees. The program allows users to store personal information about relatives, track relationships, attach media files, and generate multi-generation diagrams.
+The app is intended for genealogy research, family history documentation, and personal use.
+
+2. Functional Requirements
+2.1 Person Profile Management
+
+The program must allow users to:
+
+Add new family members
+
+Edit or delete existing profiles
+
+Enter personal details:
+
+Full name
+
+Date of birth / death
+
+Gender
+
+Photos
+
+Biography or notes
+
+Occupation (optional)
+
+2.2 Relationship Management
+
+The system must support:
+
+Parent → Child links
+
+Sibling relationships
+
+Marriage / partnership links
+
+Divorce / separation
+
+Multiple marriages
+
+Step-family or adopted family connections
+
+2.3 Tree Visualization
+
+The app should generate a visual family tree:
+
+Horizontal or vertical layout
+
+Expand/collapse generation levels
+
+Display key data next to each person
+
+Smooth navigation (scrolling, zooming)
+
+Highlight selected individual and direct relatives
+
+Optional visualization modes:
+
+Pedigree chart
+
+Descendant chart
+
+Full tree chart
+
+2.4 Search and Filtering
+
+The program must support:
+
+Search by name
+
+Search by date of birth or death
+
+Filters:
+
+By generation
+
+By surname
+
+By branch of the family
+
+Quick navigation to a selected person
+
+2.5 Media and Documents
+
+Users should be able to:
+
+Attach photos (PNG/JPG)
+
+Attach documents (PDF/notes)
+
+Link media to specific events (e.g., wedding, birth)
+
+View gallery for each family member
+
+2.6 Event Timeline (Optional)
+
+The system may include a timeline showing:
+
+Birth dates
+
+Marriages
+
+Important historical or personal events
+
+Users can view the timeline per individual or for the entire family.
+
+2.7 Data Backup & Export
+
+The application must support:
+
+Exporting family tree to:
+
+PDF (diagram)
+
+Image (PNG)
+
+GEDCOM (common genealogy format)
+
+Importing data from GEDCOM
+
+Local backup and restore
+
+2.8 User Notes & Tags
+
+Users can:
+
+Add personal notes
+
+Assign tags (e.g., “research needed”, “confirmed”, “maternal line”)
+
+Mark incomplete data
+
+3. Non-Functional Requirements
+3.1 Platform
+
+The program can be:
+
+Desktop app (Windows/Mac/Linux)
+
+Web application
+
+Mobile app (optional)
+
+3.2 Performance
+
+Trees with up to 1,000 individuals should load within 1 second
+
+Smooth zoom and navigation
+
+Efficient memory usage for large trees
+
+3.3 Data Storage
+
+Local database (SQLite recommended) or local JSON/XML files
+
+Optionally: cloud sync
+
+3.4 Security
+
+Family data must be stored locally unless cloud sync is explicitly enabled
+
+If cloud sync is used → encryption required
+
+3.5 Usability
+
+Intuitive interface
+
+Drag-and-drop features for rearranging tree (optional)
+
+Undo/redo support
+
+4. Technical Stack (Recommended)
+Option A – Desktop Application (Python)
+
+Python
+
+PyQt5 or Tkinter
+
+SQLite for database
+
+Graphviz/d3-like library for visualization
+
+Option B – Web Application
+
+Frontend: React / Vue.js
+
+Backend: Node.js / Django
+
+Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
+
+Visualization: D3.js
+
+Option C – Mobile
+
+Flutter or React Native
+
+5. Future Extensions
+
+DNA test integration (Ancestry/23andMe style)
+
+Collaboration between multiple users
+
+Automatic tree generation from uploaded documents
+
+AI-powered relationship suggestion (optional)
+
+Historical map of family migrations
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
